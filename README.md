# Smart-Face-Recognition-System-with-Unknown-Face-Detection
This Python-based project implements a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV and DeepFace for enhanced accuracy. The system captures live video feed, identifies known individuals, and handles unknown faces intelligently by saving their images after a timeout.
